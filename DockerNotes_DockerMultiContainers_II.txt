# Using :delegated option, Docker won't write changes in host machine instantly, but make it a batch process, so performance is better

# Run composer service first to install required packaged
syntax: docker-compose run --rm composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel .

# Change src folder permissions, when using permission issue in linux
syntax: sudo chmod -R 777 src/*

# Run serveral containers using docker-compose
syntax: docker-compose up -d server php mysql

# PHP 7.4 isn't compatible anymore with latest laravel, so we use PHP 8

# To simplify docker-compose up, we could couple several service to one with "depends_on" option

# By default docker-compose is not evaluate built images once created, but using --build option, we could make docker-compose to evaluate dockerfiles
syntax: docker-compose up -d --build server

# In production environment, bindmount is undesirable, since it is contradict the docker concept of standalone container
# So tweaking for copying updated snapshot that locked with container is important for production
